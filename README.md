# macos-yt-dlp-interface
YT-DLP command-line user interface for MacOS (Bash)

# What is this
This is a simple tool that allows you to use YT-DLP without headaches.
It was designed with MacOS in mind, but it 'should' work with other OSes using Bash.
With this script, you can:
  - Download almost any video and audio on the internet ;
  - Download videos as .MP3 audio files ;
  - Download Bandcamp albums quickly and efficiently ;
  - Learn more about the script's usage thanks to an elaborate menu ;
  - Any downloaded .WEBM files can be quickly converted to .MP4 ;
  - And much more!

# How to install
Prerequisites:
  1) Homebrew. Installation guide here: https://brew.sh
  2) yt-dlp and ffmpeg **on honembrew**. (_brew install yt-dlp_ and _brew install ffmpeg_)
  3) MacOS or OS X. May work with other Bash-based OSes.

Steps :
  1) Open Terminal: press command+space, write "**terminal.app**", hit enter.
  2) (Optional) Move over to your desktop: write "**cd Desktop**", hit enter.
  3) Download the repository: write "**git clone https://github.com/azeman/macos-yt-dlp-interface**", hit enter.
  4) Move over to the downloaded repository: write "**cd macos-yt-dlp-interface**", hit enter.
  5) Make the script executable: write "**chmod u+x main.command**", hit enter.
  6) That's it! Now, you can move **main.command** anywhere you wish. You should put it in a folder somewhere, and create an alias: it works just like shortcuts on Windows.

# How to use
Launch main.command (or its alias) and follow the instructions.
